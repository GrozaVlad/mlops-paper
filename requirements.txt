I want to write a paper in a journal and this is one of their themes for call for papers:

MLOps Advancements: Improving Development, Management, and Interpretability in AI and Machine Learning
Submission deadline: 31 March 2026
Motivation and Scope

The rapid advancement of data-driven artificial intelligence has accelerated the integration of machine learning (ML) models into real-world applications across diverse domains. This transition from experimental ML to production-ready AI systems has unveiled significant operational challenges in model development, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance. MLOps has emerged as a critical framework of practices and tools designed to streamline the entire ML lifecycle, ensuring automation, reproducibility, and scalability while bridging the gap between data science experimentation and the reliable operation of ML components in production.

As AI adoption continues to expand, the need for robust, scalable, and transparent MLOps practices has become increasingly vital to guarantee the reliability and trustworthiness of deployed ML models. This Special Issue seeks to gather cutting-edge research, case studies, and insights from both academia and industry that address the key challenges and emerging trends in MLOps, with particular emphasis on practical solutions for improving AI and machine learning workflows.

We invite high-quality submissions that explore, but are not limited to, the following topics:

MLOps Frameworks and Best Practices
ML pipelines orchestration
ML model reproducibility, traceability, and explainability
Continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices for ML models
ML model monitoring and observability
MLOps practices to ensure Interpretability and Explainability in AI systems
Application of MLOps principles to Knowledge and Semantic Representation
Application of MLOps principles to large language models (LLMOps)
ML-specific architecture design and patterns
Experience reports on real-world MLOps applications
Challenges in applying MLOps to specific domains (e.g., healthcare and finance)
Ethics and Accountability in MLOps
AutoML applications in MLOps
Collaboration and team dynamics in MLOps
Regulatory and policy aspects of MLOps
MLOps strategies for Green AI
Security and data privacy in MLOps
The proponents of this Special Issue are also the organizers of the Workshop on Machine Learning Operations â€“ MLOps'25, which will be held at ECAI 2025, one of the premier conferences in artificial intelligence. As part of this initiative, we aim to provide an opportunity for authors of papers accepted at the workshop to submit an extended version of their work to this Special Issue. This will enable further development of innovative research contributions presented at MLOps'25, fostering deeper discussions and broader dissemination of advancements in MLOps methodologies, tools, and applications.

I wish to create a pipeline that encompasses everything from the data step ( define data and establishing a baseline ), labelling and organising data to the modelling step ( selecting and training a model, performing error analysis ) to deployment ( deploy in production, monitoring and maintaining the system ) . The emphasis should be especially on the last part (deployment) and I want to use a model that already exists for drug repurposing lets say. I want a complete plan on the tools to use for the pipeline and a model I can use as the example( The important aspect are the mlops tools and how they help). Please give me this plan.
